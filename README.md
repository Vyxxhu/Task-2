# Task-2
Build a program that generates a
random number and challenges the
user to guess it. The program
should prompt the user to input
their guess, compare it to the
generated number, and provide
feedback if the guess is too high or
too low. It should continue until the
user correctly guesses the number
and then display the number of
attempts it took to win the game.
